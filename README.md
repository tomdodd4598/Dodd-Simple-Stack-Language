Dodd Simple Stack Language
==========================


Summary
-------

The Dodd Simple Stack Language is a very simple stack-based language. The lexing component is generated with the [SableCC](https://sablecc.org/) parser generator. The language syntax specification can be found [here](https://github.com/tomdodd4598/Dodd-Simple-Stack-Language/blob/main/src/dssl.sable).


Permissions
-----------

In practice, the license on any code I write means very little, but for those who want a some semblance of formality, let it be stated that all code is available under the [MIT License](https://github.com/tomdodd4598/Dodd-Simple-Stack-Language/blob/main/LICENSE.md).
