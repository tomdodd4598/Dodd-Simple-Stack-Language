Dodd Simple Stack Language
==========================

Summary
-------

The Dodd Simple Stack Language (DSSL) is a stack-based language, inspired primarily by Postscript, Python and Java. The lexing component is generated with the [SableCC](https://sablecc.org/) parser generator. The language syntax specification can be found [here](https://github.com/tomdodd4598/Dodd-Simple-Stack-Language/blob/main/src/dssl.sable).
